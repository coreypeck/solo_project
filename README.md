Welcome to the Triple R PG!

To use what I have, type in the text fields.

The Highest field is for game interaction
The lowest field is for local chatText

To go into a building type: go (building name)
Example: gO tAvErn_4
(The field is case-insensitive)

Before going into another building, you must leave the one you are in. Type: leave (building name)
Example: LeAvE TaVeRn_4
(This field is also Case Insensitive)

Once you leave a building, the people there will not allow you to disturb them again (You can't go back)

To go to another town type: go next town
(This field is also Case Insensitive)
Once you leave the town, you will be unable to return.
when you type in go next town, this will prompt a vote. Type "yes" (case insensitive) to agree to move on. Do nothing or type "no" to stay

Along the way you will meet Wando. He owns a cart and two Oxen. He also runs his own shop, known as Wando's wares. If you find him, he may help you in completing your quest...
